# Netflix Data Science Foundations Boot Camp Final Project
**Project Name**
:Indicators-of-Heart-Disease-Analysis

**Project description**

By asking critical questions pertaining to heart disease and its associated risk factors, healthcare administration, healthcare workers, and policy makers will be able to better understand factors that affect heart disease, what areas of research should be focused on moving forward, and offer lifestyle changes to people without heart disease to lower the risk of developing a heart disease. 

This project is about statistically analyzing risk factors for heart disease and performing A/B testing, descriptive and inferential statistic to health care plans and strategies to better understand the risk factors assocaited with heart disease and give key insights into what factors contribute most heavily and least heavily to the development of heart disease. 



Technologies used:
